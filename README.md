reflection-and-dynamic-samples
==============================

Some quick and dirty code samples associated with reflection and dynamic usage in C#:
 - simple performance comparison of different ways to dynamically invoke a method
 - basic usages of `dynamic` keyword
 - method overriding and `dynamic` keyword
 - dynamic method binding with `dynamic` keyword
 - basic capabilities of `ExpandoObject`

The code is just a set of quick code samples so it can be messy in some places.
